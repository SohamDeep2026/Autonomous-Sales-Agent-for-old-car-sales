# Web-Based AI Sales Agent project  

Welcome to the Web-Based AI Sales Agent project! This innovative system is designed to conduct natural, professional, and human-like phone conversations with customers, enabling dynamic interactions, personalized experiences, and efficient sales closure.  

## üéØ **Key Features**  
1. **Natural Voice Quality**: Uses cutting-edge text-to-speech and speech-to-text technologies for clear, human-like interactions.  
2. **Dynamic Functionality**: Calls APIs and integrates real-time data to personalize conversations.  
3. **Multi-Call Management**: Supports multiple simultaneous conversations with minimal latency.  
4. **Scalable Architecture**: Built for performance, reliability, and responsiveness.  
5. **Web Agent**: Demonstrates functionality via a web-based interface.

## üöÄ **Getting Started**  

### Prerequisites  
Ensure the following are installed:  
- **Python 3.9+**  
- **Node.js** (for backend integration)  
- **Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API**: For speech recognition.  
- **Google Text-to-Speech**: For natural voice synthesis.  

### Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ai-phone-agent.git  
   cd ai-phone-agent  
   ```  

2. Install Python dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

3. Set up environment variables:  
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following:  
   ```plaintext  
   API_KEY=your_google_cloud_key 
   ```  

4. Run the backend server:  
   ```bash  
   python app.py  
   ```  

5. (Optional) Start the web interface:  
   ```bash  
   cd web  
   npm install  
   npm start  
   ```

## üõ† **How It Works**  

### Architecture Overview  
1. **Speech-to-Text**: Captures and transcribes customer responses using SpeechRecognition object.  
2. **Dynamic Intent Recognition**: Uses an NLP engine (e.g., OpenAI GPT) to process responses and generate appropriate replies.  
3. **Real-Time APIs**: Fetches data or executes actions dynamically (e.g., checking product availability).  
4. **Text-to-Speech**: Responds with natural-sounding voice generated by Amazon Polly or Google Text-to-Speech.  
5. **Call Management**: Handles multiple calls efficiently with an asynchronous event-driven architecture.  

### Example Workflow  
1. The customer converses with the agent.  
3. The customer‚Äôs response is transcribed and analyzed for intent.  
4. The agent dynamically fetches relevant data (e.g. product details like model and pricing) via API calls.  
5. The conversation continues until a sale is closed or the call ends.

## üß© **Customization**  

- **Conversation Script**: Modify the default script in `scripts/conversation_template.json`.  
- **APIs**: Add or update APIs for fetching customer-specific data in `services/api_manager.py`.  
- **Voice Settings**: Adjust text-to-speech parameters in `config/voice_settings.py`.

## üîç **Testing the Agent**  

### Web Agent  
1. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:3000`.  
2. Simulate conversations using the built-in voice interaction module.

## üèÜ **Bonus Features**  
- **From-Scratch Design**: Key components (e.g., speech-to-text, NLP) can be implemented without external APIs for bonus points.  
- **Advanced Multi-Call Management**: Built using Redis and asynchronous tasks for superior scalability.  
- **Conversation Insights**: Logs interactions and analyzes customer behavior patterns.
